# Regression-Projects

Hi! I’m Aarushi and this repo contains beginner-friendly regression projects that helped me understand the fundamentals of supervised learning.

Each project is focused on a different use case and learning goal — from building models completely from scratch to using libraries like scikit-learn.

## Included Projects

| Project | Model | From Scratch |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/aarushitandon0/Regression-Projects/tree/main/1.%20House%20Price%20Predictor) | Linear Regression | ✅ Yes |
| [Email Spam Detection](https://github.com/aarushitandon0/Regression-Projects/tree/main/2.%20Email%20Spam%20Classifier) | Logistic Regression | ✅ Yes |
| [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/aarushitandon0/Regression-Projects/tree/main/3.%20Heart%20Disease%20Predictor) | Logistic Regression | ❌ scikit-learn | 

## Why this repo?
I built these projects while learning about regression — one of the core concepts in Machine Learning. It includes:
- Custom model building using NumPy
- Understanding cost functions & gradient descent
- Text preprocessing & classification
- Using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall
- Comparing sklearn model performance

> Each folder has its own README where I explain the logic, implementation, and learnings.
